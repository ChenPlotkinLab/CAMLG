## Paper Abstract

Affecting over five million people worldwide, Parkinson’s disease (PD) lacks disease-modifying therapies. Multiple genetic risk factors for PD have known lysosomal functions, suggesting that lysosomal pathways are important to pathogenesis. Here, we systematically screened common variants linked to PD risk by genome wide association studies (GWAS) for impact on lysosomal biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our objectives were to understand the extent to which PD-associated common variants implicate lysosomal pathways, and to identify specific variants and target genes that impact lysosomes. Starting with 525 candidate gene-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) pairs nominated by Mendelian randomization from published PD GWAS, we filtered SNPs for downstream evaluation, based on strength of association with PD and impact on brain gene expression. We genotyped the top 16 SNPs in 173 PD participants, adding three SNPs capturing variation at the TMEM106B, CTSB, and RAB29 loci, encoding genes with known lysosomal function. In the same 173 individuals, we measured 15 CSF biomarkers (including 9 lysosomal biomarkers) by parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. We tested SNPs for association with lysosomal biomarkers. Genotypes at rs12657663 (CAMLG) associated with CSF levels of cathepsin F, cathepsin L, hexosaminidase B, and tripeptidyl-peptidase I; and genotypes at rs7910668 (ITGA8) with CSF levels of cathepsin B. The protein encoded by CAMLG, Calcium Modulating Ligand (CAML), is expressed in neurons across brain regions, with higher expression in Lewy body disease (LBD) cases. Our systematic analysis of PD risk loci nominates CAMLG as a neuronally-expressed gene with effects on lysosomes.
